<h1>Submitting Data as a Data Package</h1>

<p>To submit data as a Data Package, browse to the directory you wish to package in the web interface and select 'submit as data package'. The system will then guide you through the processes of adding metadata to your package, selecting a destination repository and submitting the data.</p>


{% comment %}


RHIS is the documentation for how we THINK it should work, but not enough time to include in Beta release.


<p>You will then be given options to: <em>Submit the directory as a new Data Package</em> or <em>Add to a  Data Package</em>. Additionally, if the directory has previously been submitted as a Data Package, you will have the option to <em>Update an existing package</em>.
</p>


<p>The significance of the three options are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Submit the directory as a new Data Package</strong> - create a new Data Package with the data contained within the directory you are submitting</li>
<li><strong>Add to a Data Package</strong> - add the directory and it's data into an existing Data Package</li>
<li><strong>Update an existing package</strong> - replace the data within an exisitng Data Package with the data within the current directory.</li>
</ol>
