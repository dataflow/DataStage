<p>There are three levels of access to data within {{ settings.SITE_NAME }}: <strong>private</strong>, <strong>shared</strong> and <strong>collaborative</strong>:</p>


<ul>
	<li><strong>private:</strong> data which can only be accessed by you</li>
	
	<li><strong>shared:</strong> data to be shared between research group members </li>
	<li><strong>collaborative:</strong> data to be shared with selected external collaborators (in addition to members of your research group)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Research group leaders also have access to <em>all</em> data within a research group, including the 'private' files of individual group members.</p>


<p>Permissions within {{ settings.SITE_NAME }} are managed by file organisation; that is what permissions a particular set of data has is determined by where it is located.
