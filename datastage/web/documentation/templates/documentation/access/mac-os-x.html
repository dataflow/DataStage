<h1>Data file access from MacOS</h1>

<p>Data files may be accessed from MacOS as a Windows network share:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>smb://{{ hostname }}/datastage</code>
</blockquote>
<p>A username and password will be required to complete a connection.
</p>

<p>To connect a Windows share from MacOS, use the Finder <strong>Go > Connect to server...</strong> menu command (or <strong>COMMAND-K</strong> shortcut), and enter:

  <code>smb://<cite>username</cite>@{{ hostname }}/datastage</code> as the server address. The system will then prompt for the specified user's password.	
</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>
