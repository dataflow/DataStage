<h1>Accessing data using WebDAV</h1>

<p>Selected DATASTAGE data files may be accessed using the web file access
   protocol, using one of the following forms of URL:

<ul id="webdav-urls">
  <li><a href="http{{ is_secure|yesno:"s," }}://{{ hostname }}{% url browse:index "private/" %}">http{{ is_secure|yesno:"s," }}://{{ hostname }}{% url browse:index "private/" %}</a></li>
  <li><a href="http{{ is_secure|yesno:"s," }}://{{ hostname }}{% url browse:index "shared/" %}">http{{ is_secure|yesno:"s," }}://{{ hostname }}{% url browse:index "shared/" %}</a></li>
  <li><a href="http{{ is_secure|yesno:"s," }}://{{ hostname }}{% url browse:index "collab/" %}">http{{ is_secure|yesno:"s," }}://{{ hostname }}{% url browse:index "collab/" %}</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A username and password will be required.  Access controls are enforced as
   described for local network file access page.</p>

<p>Web file access (WebDAV) support is slower and sometimes less reliable than
   local network file sharing. It is provided for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It can be used from a system outside the Zoology Department network.</li>
  <li>It can be used by web browser based applications used for annotation,
      visualization and other tasks.</li>
</ol>

<section>
  <h2>Web file access using Windows</h2>

  <p>Currently, the Windows web file access software does not work with the
     DATASTAGE server and file protection arrangements &mdash; we'll be looking
     in to this.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Web file access using MacOS</h2>

  <p>To connect a web file system share from MacOS, use the Finder <strong>Go →
     Connect to server&hellip;</strong> menu command (or <strong>⌘-K</strong> shortcut), and enter one
     of the <a href="#webdav-urls">URLs shown above</a> as the server address.</p>

  <p>The system will then prompt for a username and password.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Web file access using Linux</h2>

  <p>Under Linux with GNOME, the DATASTAGE web file system content can be
     accessed in similar fashion to a local file system, but using the web
     address.</p>

  <p>Use the <strong>Places → Connect to server&hellip;</strong> menu command. In the pop-up
     window, from the <strong>Service type</strong> drop-down menu, select
     <strong>{% if is_secure %}Secure WebDAV (HTTPS){% else %}WebDAV (HTTP){% endif %}</strong>.
     Under <strong>Server</strong> enter <code>{{ hostname }}</code> and under <strong>Folder</strong> enter
     <code>data/</code>. Fill in the username and password fields with your
     local credentials for this site.</p>

  <p>An alternative mechanism for reading and writing files under Linux is to
     use the <code>cadaver</code> command-line utility, specifying one of the
     URL forms listed above.</p>
