<h1>Setting up local file access</h1>

<h2 id="windows" >Windows</h2>

<p>Data files are accessed from Windows as a network share:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>\\{{ hostname }}\datastage</code>
</blockquote>

<p>A username and password will be required to complete a connection.
The username entered should be in workgroup <code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}</code>; e.g. <code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}\<cite>username</cite></code>.
</p>

<p>There are many ways to connect a share in Windows.
One is to use Windows Explorer's "<strong>ools > Map Network Drive...</strong> menu command.
</p>

<p>On Windows 7, click on the <strong>Start</strong> button, then click on <strong>My Computer</strong>, and one of the toolbar options displayed is <strong>Map network drive</strong>.
</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>


<h2 id="mac" >Mac OS</h2>

<p>Data files may be accessed from your Mac as a Windows network share:</p>
<blockquote>
<code>smb://{{ hostname }}/datastage</code>
</blockquote>
<p>A username and password will be required to complete a connection.
</p>

<p>To connect a Windows share from your Mac, use the Finder <strong>Go > Connect to server...</strong> menu command (or <strong>COMMAND-K</strong> shortcut), and enter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <code>smb://<em>username</em>@{{ hostname }}/datastage</code> as the server address.
</blockquote>

<p>The system will then prompt for the specified user's password.	
</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>


<h2 id="linux" >Linux</h2>

<p>Data files can be accessed from Linux as a network share:</p>

<p>If using GNOME, use the <strong>Places &gt; Connect to server ...</strong> menu command.  A popup window will appear.  From the <strong>Service type</strong>
drop-down menu, select <strong>Windows share</strong>.  Under <strong>Server</strong> enter <code>{{ hostname }}</code> and under
<strong>Share</strong> enter <code>data</code>.  Under <strong>Username</strong> enter <code>username</code> and under <strong>Domain</strong> enter
<code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}</code> and then click on <strong>Connect</strong>.  Another popup window will then appear,
into which the password for <cite>username</cite> should be entered.</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>

<h3>For advanced users</h3>
<p>For advanced users, it is also possible to mount the filesystem directly, using the command:
<blockquote>
<code>
mount.cifs //{{ hostname }}/datastage <em>mountpoint</em> -o rw,user=<em>username</em>,password=<em>userpass</em>,nounix,forcedirectio
</code>
</blockquote>

where <em>mountpoint</em> has already been created.</p>
