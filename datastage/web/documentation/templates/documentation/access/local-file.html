<h1>Setting up local file access</h1>

<h2 id="windows" >Windows</h2>

<p>Data files are accessed from Windows as a network share:
<blockquote>
<code>\\{{ hostname }}\data</code>
</blockquote>
A username and password will be required to complete a connection.
The username entered should be in workgroup <code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}</code>; e.g. <code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}\<cite>username</cite></code>.
</p>

<p>There are many ways to connect a share in Windows.
One is to use Windows Explorer's "Tools > Map Network Drive..." menu command.
</p>

<p>On Windows 7, click on the "Start" button, then click on "My Computer", and one of the toolbar options displayed is "Map network drive".
</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>


<h2 id="mac" >Mac OS</h2>

<p>Data files may be accessed from your Mac as a Windows network share:
<blockquote>
<code>smb://{{ hostname }}/data</code>
</blockquote>
A username and password will be required to complete a connection.
</p>

<p>To connect a Windows share from your Mac, use the Finder "Go > Connect to server..." menu command (or COMMAND-K shortcut), and enter
<blockquote>
  <code>smb://<cite>username</cite>@{{ hostname }}/data</code> as the server address.
</blockquote>
The system will then prompt for the specified user's password.	
</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>


<h2 id="linux" >Linux</h2>

<p>Data files can be accessed from Linux as a network share:</p>

<p>If using GNOME, use the "Places &gt; Connect to server ..." menu command.  A popup window will appear.  From the "Service type"
drop-down menu, select "Windows share".  Under "Server" enter <code>{{ hostname }}</code> and under
"Share" enter <code>data</code>.  Under "Username" enter <cite>username</cite> and under "Domain" enter
<code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}</code> and then click on "Connect".  Another popup window will then appear,
into which the password for <cite>username</cite> should be entered.</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>

<p><strong>For advanced users</strong>, it is also possible to mount the filesystem directly, using the command:
<blockquote>
<code>
mount.cifs //{{ hostname }}/data <cite>mountpoint</cite> -o rw,user=<cite>username</cite>,password=<cite>userpass</cite>,nounix,forcedirectio
</code>
</blockquote>

where <cite>mountpoint</cite> has already been created.</p>
