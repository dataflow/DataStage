<h1>Data file access from Windows</h1>

<p>Data files are accessed from Windows as a network share:
<blockquote>
<code>\\{{ hostname }}\datastage</code>
</blockquote>
A username and password will be required to complete a connection.
The username entered should be in workgroup <code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}</code>; e.g. <code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}\<cite>username</cite></code>.
</p>

<p>There are many ways to connect a share in Windows.
One is to use Windows Explorer's "Tools > Map Network Drive..." menu command.
</p>

<p>On Windows 7, click on the "Start" button, then click on "My Computer", and one of the toolbar options displayed is "Map network drive".
</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>
