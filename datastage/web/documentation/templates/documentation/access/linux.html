<h1>Data file access from Linux</h1>

<p>Data files can be accessed from Linux as a network share:</p>

<p>If using GNOME, use the "Places &gt; Connect to server ..." menu command.  A popup window will appear.  From the "Service type"
drop-down menu, select "Windows share".  Under "Server" enter <code>{{ hostname }}</code> and under
"Share" enter <code>data</code>.  Under "Username" enter <cite>username</cite> and under "Domain" enter
<code>{{ settings.GROUP_NAME }}</code> and then click on "Connect".  Another popup window will then appear,
into which the password for <cite>username</cite> should be entered.</p>

<p>Once connected, a user will be able to read/write files in their own private area,
and also to read all files in the <code>shared</code> and <code>collab</code> areas.
</p>

<p><strong>For advanced users</strong>, it is also possible to mount the filesystem directly, using the command:
<blockquote>
<code>
mount.cifs //{{ hostname }}/data <cite>mountpoint</cite> -o rw,user=<cite>username</cite>,password=<cite>userpass</cite>,nounix,forcedirectio
</code>
</blockquote>

where <cite>mountpoint</cite> has already been created.</p>
