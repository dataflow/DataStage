<h1>Adding and removing users</h1>

<p>Currently, in order to add or remove users you will have to be logged into the <code>datastage</code> server.</p>

<h2> Admin Command line interface </h2>
<p> At the admin command line interface type:
   <code> sudo datastage-config </code> </p>
<p>  If it prompts for the password enter the admin password.</p> 
<p>   Select u -'users' to add/delete accounts </p> 

<h2>To add a user:</h2>
<p>Follow the instructions stated in the 'admin command line interface' section.</p>
<p>   Select a -'add' to add a new user(note the password it generates) or </p> 

<p> The Role of the user needs to be provided while creating the account.</p> 
<p> Role: Leader/Member/Collaborator</p> 
<p> r/w - Read/Write ; r - read only; NA - No Area</p> 

<h4> Leader:</h4> 
<p> The leader/head of the research group selects this role.</p> 
<blockquote>
<code>  
<table>    
 <tr><td></td><td> Own area </td><td>  Other's area</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Private : </td><td> r/w </td><td> r</td>               
 <tr><td>Shared  :</td><td> r/w</td><td>  r </td></tr>               
 <tr><td>Collab  :</td><td> r/w </td><td>r/w</td></tr>               
 </code>
 </table>  
 </blockquote>

<h4> Member:</h4> 
<p> Any member who is not the head/leader of the research group selects this role.</p> 
<blockquote>
<code>  
<table>
 <tr><td></td><td> Own area</td><td> Other's area</td></tr>
 <tr><td> Private: </td><td>r/w</td><td>no access</td></tr>
 <tr><td> Shared :</td><td>r/w</td><td>r</td></tr>
 <tr><td> Collab : </td><td>r/w</td><td>r/w</td></tr>
 </code>
 </table>  
 </blockquote>
 
<h4> Collaborator:</h4> 
<p>  A person from one group holds this role within another research group for collaboration.
 A collaborator does not have his own private/shared/collab areas, but just holds an account on the system.
</p> 
<blockquote>
<code>  
<table> 
<tr><td> </td><td>Own area </td><td>  Other's area</td></tr>
<tr><td> Private: </td><td>   NA </td><td> no access</td></tr>
<tr><td> Shared :</td><td>   NA </td><td> no access</td></tr>
<tr><td>  Collab :</td><td>   NA </td><td>    r/w</td></tr>
</code>  
</table>  
</blockquote>


<h2>To change a user password</h2>
<p>The users can change their own passwords by logging into their accounts and executing the following commands.
</p>
<p>To change your own password:
<blockquote>
<code>passwd</code>
<code>smbpasswd</code>
</blockquote>
the system will prompt for the old password, then the new password to be entered twice.</p>

<p>If you are logged in to an account with system administration capabilities, 
you can also change the password for any user without having to enter the 
previous password:
<blockquote>
<code>sudo su -</code><br/>
<code>passwd <cite>username</cite></code>
<code>smbpasswd -a <cite>username</cite></code>
</blockquote></p>

<h2>To remove a user:</h2>
<p>Follow the instructions stated in the 'admin command line interface' section.</p>
<p>Select r - 'remove' to remove an existing user.</p>
<p>Select 'purge' to delete the data and the account or </p>
<p>Select 'yes' to delete the account and retain the data in which case the data remains orphaned. 
The user will be removed form the filesystem and all their files will be changed to ownership by a special "orphaned data" account (datastage-orphan).
The effect of this is that the original owners access rights are removed.  Specifically, only the group leader
can access the users private files.
</p>

<p>In the future it is intended that there will be a web-interface to these commands so no magic incantations need be remembered!</p>
