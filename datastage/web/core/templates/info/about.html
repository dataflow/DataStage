  <h1>About</h1>
  
<p>This page can be customised by the user.</p>

<p>DataStage is a secure personalized 'local' file management environment for use at the research group level, appearing as a mapped drive on the user's PC. 
  This allows users to save files to the cloud simply by clicking "save" in Excel or another application, provides additional Web access and DropBox integration, is configurable to have private, shared, collaborative, public and communal directories with easy-to-configure access controls, is secured by means of automated daily backup, and has the flexibility of dynamically invoking additional cloud storage as need dictates. 
  You can find out more about it on www.dataflow.ox.ac.uk.</p>
