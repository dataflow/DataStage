  <h1>About</h1>
  

<p>DataStage is a secure personalized 'local' file management environment for use at the research group level, appearing as a mapped drive on the user's PC. 
 
 This allows users to work on files and save them directly witin the environment.</p>
 
 
 <p>The system also provides additional Web access and DropBox integration. Access control is managed through the use of private, shared, collaborative, public and communal directories with easy-to-configure access controls.</p>
 
 
 
<p>	Data security is provided by means of automated daily backup, and has the flexibility of dynamically invoking additional cloud storage as need dictates.
DataStage doesn't apply version control to your files, though external version control systems can be used in conjunction with DataStage.
</p>
